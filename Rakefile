It's not good to study in a dusty room. Would you like to see that thing at night? My chin is almost an inch long. Grab something cool to brag about. Don't act like a cat in public, please. It was our Daisy, robed like a princess, but bored all day long. Let's save that vase for later. Can an angel glean upon us? I seriously got stressed from resisting those desserts. Do you ever fluster, or are you always restful?  Do you prefer the smell of lemon or melon?" }
